Instructions:
1. To start venv, enter:
    $ .  venv/bin/activate

2. To start flask server, enter:
    $ ./start_hello.sh

    NOTE: If after running ./start_hello.sh you get an error message saying "port 5000 in use", edit start_hello.sh to say "flask app hello run -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5001".  Use 5002, 5003 etc, until you find an open port.  Don't go above 5010 tho, apparently Mad Dog didn't open those 

3. To kill flask server, enter:
    ^C

4. To close venv, enter:
    $ deactivate
